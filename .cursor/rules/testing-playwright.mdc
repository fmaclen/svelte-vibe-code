# Playwright Testing

- **Test dir**: [`e2e/`](mdc:e2e)
- **Server**: Playwright starts the app with `npm run build && npm run preview` per [`playwright.config.ts`](mdc:playwright.config.ts).
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:4173` (see config).
- **Convex**: Ensure `npm run convex` is running when executing tests locally.
- **Run tests**: `npm test` (sets the Convex test env var automatically).
- **Artifacts**: Traces retained on failure; outputs under `test-results/`.
